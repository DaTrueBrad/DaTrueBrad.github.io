            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Hello! Welcome to my page! I am a full-stack web developer with React/Javascript, NodeJS, Express, and PostgresSQL! Having gone through an advanced/accelerated course for web development at Dev Mountain in Lehi, I have been able to build out a few projects to illustrate my skills. Check them out below! My hobbies include powerlifting, hiking, and backpacking.
            </p>

        <p>I started my career as a personal trainer, which quickly turned into a fitness manager position due to my ability to lead coupled with my drive to learn and apply. That's where I fell in love with powerlifting, which has become so much more than just a sport for me. Powerlifting taught me that I can push through hard things, do things that may not be fun or enjoyable, and even to somewhat like those hard and unenjoyable things.</p>
        <p>My experience at Dev Mountain has been fantastic, and I woul dnot trade it for anything in the world. My class was only seven large, which allowed for a lot of one-on-one time as needed. However, me being my dard-driven self, I enjoyed working through problems for a long time on my own. We were able to cover more than just my engineering stack as well, going into languages and frameworks such as python and cryptosecurity. I have the most experience in react and javscript, as that was the core language during my study.</p>

            My core language is React and Javacript, and I have in-depth knowledge with HTML and CSS as well, since they are a part of my stack. Beyond the skills listed here I also work with other frameworks and languages such as JSON, Jest, Selenium, BcryptJS, RESTful API, and Agile. Exposure to other languages in some degree have also occurred, but not enough for it to be listed here.
